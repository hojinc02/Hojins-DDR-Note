# Hojins-Minimal-DDR-Note
This is a minimal and function focused version of Peter's DDR Note noteskin for the rhythm game StepMania (and StepMania adjacent games). Assets from HURG-IIDX's customizable noteskins were used here as well. 

To use the noteskin, extract the [ddr-minimal](ddr-minimal) folder into the Noteskins folder in StepMania. 

## Changes
- Only Marvelous judgement notes will have the bright spiked explosion effects.
- Hold bodies were simplified. 
- Hold heads are tap notes for better clarity.
- Made slight visual changes to explosions and notes.
- Fixed bottomcaps of hold and roll notes being misaligned by a few pixels.
