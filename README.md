# Hojins-Minimal-DDR-Note
This is a minimal and function focused version of Peter's DDR Note noteskin for the rhythm game StepMania (and StepMania adjacent games). Assets from HURG-IIDX's customizable noteskins were used here as well. 

To use the noteskin, download the [minimal-ddr-note](minimal-ddr-note) folder and place it in Noteskins folder in Stepmania. 

## Changes
- Only Marvelous judgement notes will have the bright spiked explosion effects.
- Hold bodies were simplified. 
- Hold heads are tap notes for better clarity.
- Made slight visual changes to explosions and notes.
