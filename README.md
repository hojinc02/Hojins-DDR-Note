## Notes
To use the noteskin, extract the [ddr-minimal.zip](ddr-minimal.zip) file into the Noteskins folder in StepMania. 

In ITGMania the hold bottom caps are slightly off so use the fixed pngs in the itg folder in the zip file. 

Player mine.wav is a royalty free sound effect I found on the internet. It sounds like an electric zap. To use it, replace the appropriate audio file in the Theme folder.
