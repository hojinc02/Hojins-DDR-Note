# Hojins-DDR-Note
This is a function focused version of Peter's DDR Note noteskin for the rhythm game StepMania (and StepMania adjacent games). Assets from HURG-IIDX's customizable noteskins were used here as well. 

To use the noteskin, extract the [ddr-minimal.zip](ddr-minimal.zip) file into the Noteskins folder in StepMania. 

(In ITGMania the hold bottom caps were showing up slightly off so the fixed versions are included in a folder)

## Changes
- Hold heads are tap notes.
- Only Marvelous judgement notes have the bright spiked explosion effects.
- Visual changes made to explosions and notes.
